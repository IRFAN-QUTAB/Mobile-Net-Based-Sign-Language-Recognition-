#Tailored MobileNet Self-Attention KNN (TMSK) for Sign Language Recognition

This repository presents a hybrid deep learning and machine learning framework designed for efficient and accurate sign language recognition (SLR). The proposed Tailored MobileNet Self-Attention KNN (TMSK) model combines the feature extraction capability of MobileNet, the global spatial understanding of a Self-Attention module, and the robust classification power of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The model is optimized for portability, low memory usage, and real-time performance, making it suitable for deployment on mobile and embedded systems.

#Overview
üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The TMSK architecture is composed of three major components:

##Tailored MobileNet Backbone:

Modified lightweight convolutional layers for efficient local feature extraction.

Depthwise separable convolutions reduce computation while preserving detail.

##Self-Attention Block:

Enhances the feature map by modeling long-range spatial dependencies.

Improves the network‚Äôs understanding of complex gestures and overlapping hand movements.

##KNN Classifier:

Replaces the traditional dense classification head with a lightweight and interpretable KNN model.

Achieves high accuracy with minimal memory footprint (~5 MB).

‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing & Data Augmentation

A robust preprocessing pipeline was implemented to ensure clean and consistent input across datasets:

Hand Detection and Cropping: Using MediaPipe Hands to detect hand landmarks and crop bounding boxes.

Fixed Margin Cropping: A 20-pixel margin added to preserve context around the hand region.

Noise Reduction: Gaussian blurring to smooth illumination variations.

Resizing: All images resized to 224√ó224 pixels for MobileNet compatibility.

üóÇÔ∏è Datasets Used

The model was trained and tested on multiple benchmark datasets to assess performance and generalization:
